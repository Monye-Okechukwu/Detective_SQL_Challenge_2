### About

It was a wonderful experience to participate in the  [Data Analytics Super League Challenge](https://www.lighthall.co/competition/ac2b4575-c81e-4a2b-8a58-576e1e442325) by LIGHTHALL. This is challenge 2 - [Detective SQL: Unravelling the Murder Mystery](https://www.lighthall.co/challenge/cd01c981-69e2-4f45-93c5-15c102868b68)

As a skilled data analyst proficient in SQL, I fearlessly tackled a baffling murder case, leveraging my data analysis expertise to meticulously organize, analyze crime scene reports, testimonies, and surveillance footage, and unearthing critical clues that I creatively visualized through data storytelling.
